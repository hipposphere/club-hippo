## 1. Core Package Registry

Implements the [Dart Pub Repository Specification v2](https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/repository-spec-v2.md).

### Package Hosting

- **List all versions** of a package (`GET /api/packages/<package>`)
- **Inspect a specific version** (`GET /api/packages/<package>/versions/<version>`)
- **Download archives** (`GET /api/archives/<package>-<version>.tar.gz`)
- **Legacy download redirect** (`GET /packages/<package>/versions/<version>.tar.gz`)
- Full compatibility with `dart pub get` and `flutter pub get`
- Full compatibility with `dart pub publish`
- Support for `PUB_HOSTED_URL` environment variable
- Support for per-dependency `hosted` URLs in `pubspec.yaml`
- Support for `dart pub token add` credential management

### Package Publishing

- **Two-phase upload flow** adapted for self-hosted deployment:
  1. Client requests upload URL → server returns URL pointing back to itself
  2. Client POSTs tarball as multipart form data directly to the server
  3. Client finalizes upload → server validates, stores, and indexes
- Archive validation:
  - Valid `.tar.gz` format
  - Valid `pubspec.yaml` with required fields
  - Canonical semantic version (via `pub_semver`)
  - Package name validation (lowercase, alphanumeric + underscore, 1-64 chars)
  - SHA-256 hash computation and storage
- README, CHANGELOG, and library list extraction from archive
- Duplicate version detection (idempotent if SHA-256 matches, rejected if different)
- Upload session management with expiration and cleanup
- Configurable max upload size (default: 100 MB)
- Rate limiting per user (configurable burst/hourly limits)

### Version Management

- Semantic version ordering (stable, prerelease, preview)
- Automatic `latest` version tracking (latest stable, latest prerelease)
- Version retraction (`PUT /api/packages/<package>/versions/<version>/options`)
- Retracted versions remain downloadable but excluded from resolution

### Package Metadata

- Full pubspec stored as JSON per version
- README content (Markdown) per version
- CHANGELOG content (Markdown) per version
- Library list per version
- Archive size and SHA-256 hash per version
- Published timestamp per version
- Uploader identity per version

---

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

All access requires authentication. There is no anonymous/public access.

### User Accounts

- Email/password authentication (bcrypt hashed, cost=12)
- Admin-created accounts (no self-registration)
- Admin and regular user roles
- Account enable/disable by admin
- Display name per user

### API Tokens

- Named API tokens for CI/CD integration
- Token format: `club_<32-char-hex>` (39 chars total)
- Tokens stored as SHA-256 hash (raw token shown once at creation, never retrievable)
- First 8 characters stored as prefix for display/identification
- Optional expiration date per token
- Token scopes: `read`, `write`, `admin`
- Last-used timestamp tracking
- Token revocation
- Multiple tokens per user

### Session Management

- JWT-based web sessions (HMAC-SHA256 signed)
- Configurable session TTL (default: 1 hour)
- HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
- CSRF protection on state-modifying web endpoints

### Authorization Model

- **Server admin**: full access to all operations
- **Publisher admin**: can publish to publisher-owned packages, manage members
- **Publisher member**: can publish to publisher-owned packages
- **Package uploader**: can publish new versions to packages they own
- **Authenticated user**: can browse, download, search, like packages

### dart pub Integration

- Compatible with `dart pub token add <server-url>`
- Compatible with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Compatible with `PUB_HOSTED_URL` environment variable
- Compatible with `--hosted-url` flag
- Proper `401 Unauthorized` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` header
- Proper `403 Forbidden` for insufficient permissions

---

## 3. Web UI

Visually identical to pub.dev. Built with SvelteKit (`adapter-static`),
compiled to static HTML/JS/CSS at Docker build time, and served by the
Dart shelf server. No Node.js at runtime. Uses pub.dev's CSS/design system.

- **Monitoring**: check package health, version counts, etc.

### Usage

```dart
import 'package:club_api/club_api.dart';

final client = ClubClient(
  serverUrl: Uri.parse('https://club.example.com'),
  token: 'club_a1b2c3d4...',
);

// List versions of a package
final packageData = await client.packages.listVersions('my_package');
print(packageData.latest.version);

// Search packages
final results = await client.search.query('http client');
for (final hit in results.hits) {
  print(hit.package);
}

// Publish a package
final archive = File('my_package-1.0.0.tar.gz').openRead();
await client.publishing.publish(archive);

// Create an API token
final token = await client.auth.createToken(name: 'CI Token');
print(token.secret); // shown once
```

See [CLIENT_SDK.md](CLIENT_SDK.md) for full documentation.

## 10. Docker & Deployment

### Docker Image

- Multi-stage build: `dart:stable` (build) → `debian:bookworm-slim` (runtime)
- Native binary built with `dart build cli` (~80MB final image)
- Non-root user (`club:1000`)
- Single `/data` volume for database + packages
- Health check endpoint at `/api/v1/health`
- Configurable via environment variables

### docker-compose

- Default: single container with SQLite + filesystem (zero dependencies)
- Optional: PostgreSQL override (`docker-compose.postgres.yml`)
- Named volumes for data persistence
- `.env` file for secrets

### Reverse Proxy

- **Caddy** (recommended): automatic TLS via Let's Encrypt, zero-config
- **nginx**: manual TLS configuration, provided config template
- `client_max_body_size: 100m` for tarball uploads
- Proper header forwarding (`X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Real-IP`)

### Backup & Restore

- SQLite: safe online backup via `.backup` command
- PostgreSQL: `pg_dump` / `pg_restore`
- Filesystem blobs: archive `/data/blobs/`
- Provided backup/restore shell scripts
- Single-volume snapshot for atomic consistency

## 11. Storage Backends

All storage is abstracted behind interfaces. Swap implementations by changing
one environment variable.

### Metadata Store (`MetadataStore` interface)

| Backend | Env Value | Dependencies | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **SQLite** (default) | `sqlite` | None (bundled) | Single-server, up to ~10K packages |
| PostgreSQL | `postgres` | External PostgreSQL | Multi-server, large scale |

### Blob Store (`BlobStore` interface)

| Backend | Env Value | Package | Dependencies | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Filesystem** (default) | `filesystem` | `club_storage` | None | Single-server, Docker volume |
| S3-compatible | `s3` | `club_storage_s3` | S3-compatible endpoint, HMAC keys | Distributed, CDN, large storage |
| Firebase Storage / GCS | `gcs` (alias: `firebase`) | `club_storage_firebase` | Service-account JSON or ADC | Native GCP integration without HMAC keys |

Each cloud backend lives in its own package and is pulled into `club_server`
as an opt-in dependency. `club_storage` stays lean with just the interface
and the filesystem implementation — tooling that only needs filesystem
storage doesn't drag in `minio` or `googleapis`.

The `s3` backend works against any S3-compatible provider — one
implementation covers all of them. Switching is a `.env` change; there is
no separate backend per S3-compatible provider.

**Verified providers:**

| Provider | Backend | Endpoint / Bucket | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| AWS S3 | `s3` | endpoint omitted; region `us-east-1` etc. | SDK derives host from region |
| Cloudflare R2 | `s3` | `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`, region `auto` | Zero egress fees; presigned downloads bypass the server entirely |
| MinIO | `s3` | `http://minio:9000` | Self-hosted; `http` allowed only for `localhost` / `minio` host |
| DigitalOcean Spaces | `s3` | `https://<region>.digitaloceanspaces.com` | |
| Backblaze B2 | `s3` | `https://s3.<region>.backblazeb2.com` | |
| Firebase Storage / GCS (interop) | `s3` | `https://storage.googleapis.com`, bucket `<project>.appspot.com`, HMAC keys | Fastest path to Firebase; uses the GCS XML API |
| Firebase Storage / GCS (native) | `gcs` | service-account JSON → inline JSON → ADC | First-class GCP auth; no HMAC keys; signed URLs require the JSON path (ADC falls back to server-proxy) |

**How it works:**

- The server streams uploads directly to the bucket; the SHA-256 hash is
  computed on the same byte stream.
- A tiny sidecar object (`<package>/<version>.json`) stores the size,
  hash, and upload timestamp so metadata reads don't need to download
  the archive.
- Package downloads redirect the client to a **presigned URL** valid for
  one hour — the server never proxies bytes on the hot path. This is the
  main operational win of the S3 backend.
- TLS is enforced: plaintext `http://` endpoints are rejected unless the
  host is `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or the docker-compose service name
  `minio` (for local development).
- Bucket existence is verified at startup — misconfigured credentials
  fail fast with a clear error rather than surfacing during the first
  publish.

**Out of scope (intentional):**

- Admin UI settings for storage config. Switching backends is a
  deployment action, not a runtime one.
- Automatic migration between filesystem and S3. Use provider tooling
  (`aws s3 sync`, `mc mirror`, `rclone`) to copy existing blobs, then
  flip the env var. See the Self-Hosting docs for a step-by-step guide.

### Search Index (`SearchIndex` interface)

| Backend | Env Value | Dependencies | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **SQLite FTS5** (default) | `sqlite` | None (bundled) | Single-server, up to ~10K packages |
| Meilisearch | `meilisearch` | External Meilisearch | Advanced search, typo tolerance |

---

## 12. Configuration

All configuration via environment variables (Docker-friendly) with optional
YAML config file override.
